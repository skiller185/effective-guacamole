# Project Blueprint: effective-guacamole

This document outlines the steps for developing the program described in README.md, focusing initially on the "Hello World" goal.

## 1. Project Initialization and Setup

* Define the initial "Hello World" project scope: Make a Gemini API call with a file input and output to a file.
* Set up project repository (e.g., Git).
* Choose necessary technologies and libraries for API interaction and file handling (e.g., Python with `google-generativeai` library).
* Configure development environment, including setting up API credentials securely.
* Establish a basic project structure for input/output files and scripts.

## 2. Design and Planning (for Hello World)

* Outline the simple program flow:
    * Read content from an input file.
    * Prepare the content for the Gemini API call.
    * Make the API call.
    * Process the API response.
    * Write the response to an output file.
* Identify potential input and output file formats (e.g., `.txt`, `.md`).

## 3. Development (for Hello World)

* Implement the file reading functionality.
* Implement the Gemini API call using the chosen library.
* Implement the file writing functionality.
* Write basic tests for file I/O and API interaction.
* Integrate the components into a single script or basic program.

## 4. Testing (Initial)

* Test the script with various input files.
* Verify that the API call is successful and returns expected output.
* Check that the output is correctly written to the specified file.

## 5. Future Expansion / Beyond Hello World

* **Design and Planning:** As outlined in the README, plan for integrating LLMs in other ways. Design specifications, database schemas, and API structures will be developed here for future features.
* **Development:** Implement additional features and modules based on the expanded design.
* **Testing:** Conduct comprehensive testing for all new functionalities.
* **Deployment:** Plan and execute deployment strategies for the evolving project.
* **Maintenance and Monitoring:** Establish processes for ongoing maintenance and monitoring of the deployed application(s).
* **Documentation:** Create and maintain documentation for all aspects of the project.

This blueprint will evolve as `effective-guacamole` grows beyond its initial "Hello World" stage.
